There are multiple ways of getting involved:

- [Report a bug](#report-a-bug) 
- [Suggest a feature](#suggest-a-feature) 
- [Contribute code](#contribute-code) 

Below are a few guidelines we would like you to follow.
If you need help, please reach out to us by opening an issue.

## Report a bug

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. Before creating a bug report, please check that an [issue](/issues) reporting the same problem does not already exist. If there is such an issue, you may add your information as a comment.

## Suggest a feature

To request a new feature you should open an [issue](../../issues/new) and summarize the desired functionality and its use case. Set the issue label to "feature". 

## Contribute code

This is an outline of what the workflow for code contributions looks like

- Check the list of open [issues](../../issues). Either assign an existing issue to yourself, or 
create a new one that you would like work on and discuss your ideas and use cases.
