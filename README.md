## Installation

BNet is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/BNet) but fist; make sure that you are working on the workspace not the project, otherwise you need to first initialize the workspace. Simply go to the project directory in terminal and run  `pod init`, then cocoa will handle for initializing and creating the workspace. Next, open _Podfile_ and add the following script to the file below the line _Pods for <PROJECT_NAME>_

```ruby
pod 'BNet'
```

Now open again the terminal and run following command

```bash
